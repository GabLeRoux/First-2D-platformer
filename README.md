# First 2D-platformer project <br/>
<br/>
Description of the project : <br/>
This is a individual school project that I had 6-7 weeks. <br/>
I did a classic platformer where you need to collect fruits to gain points and where the main objective is to saves your friends.<br/>
I did everything except the assets and sounds.<br/>
I used the new input system for the project.<br/>
Unity Game Engine version used : 2021.1.17f1. <br/><br/>

What I did :<br/>
-All player controls and a walljump.<br/>
-A system to control saws, spikeballs and blocks speed and distance from the inspector.<br/>
-A system to generate fruits randomly from a position. Can be control from the inspector.<br/>
-All UI, controls setting and encrage to fit with all screen size.<br/>
-A system that when you press 'ESC' in the UI menu you switch to the previous menu.<br/>
-A checkpoint and respawn system.<br/>
-Particules effects.<br/>

Game Controls : <br/>
-a,d or left and right arrow to move.<br/>
-space, w or up arrow to jump.<br/>
-jump on wall and go on the other to use wall jump. <br/>
-esc for game pause.<br/>
